To improve my understanding of CNNs, I attempted to make my own custom CNN. I used this Kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikolasgegenava/popular-street-foods).

TODO:
- Add more evaluation metrics.
- Modularise my convulation blocks using Sequential()
- Add skip connection like in ResNet.
